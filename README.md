# DFA Minimizer
### Overview
This program provides a minimized version of a deterministic finite automata (DFA). It also provides parsing of strings in the same file. Results are displayed in the console.

Sample data to provide the program are included as `.dfa` files. If the program minimized the DFA correctly, then both attempts at parsing the strings should be the same. The initial state of the DFA should be 0.
